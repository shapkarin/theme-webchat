## Background

Humans communicate in many ways other than words. A facial expression, a gesture...all these things can make the receiver feel differently.
Right now our chatbots only communicate through words and some other structured graphical information.
But these are not conversational, they make you feel like you're in an office.

If you want to succeed in gaining someone's trust, you need to communicate with them in way they understand.

## Goal

Make a chatbot demo based on demographics. 

### Test demographics

- 20s person working in tech
- 20s beauty-focused female

## Server

A regular API server

### Libs

- Express
- Sequelize
- Dotenv


## Client

### Libs

- Typescript
- React

### Messages

Changes style based on user object with `style` property on it. This could also be switched on some sort of demographic info, but is probably best handled by the server.

Message object itself is regular JSON object from backend.


### Mesage Types 

1. Text Message
2. Typing (didn't finish)
